This image contains sshd, for Travis build cache uploading.
sshd is configured to only allow connections from the 'cache' user.
User password is set through the PASSWD variable. The container will fail if not set.
The /key directory hold the server's key and /cache can be used for cache uploading.

Example invocation:

docker build -t cache .
sudo mkdir -p /cache/{key,cache}
docker run -d -e 'PASSWD=secure' -v '/cache/key:/key' -v '/cache/cache:/cache' -p 2222:22
